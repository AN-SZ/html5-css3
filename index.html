        <p>
            Good morning to one and all present here! We all know about music. I am going to deliver my speech on Music. Music is a pleasing arrangement and flow of sounds in air and of course, it varies in rhythm and systematic method.
            The release of endorphins is also thought to be one of the reasons music is so emotionally powerful. Endorphins are hormones that are released by the brain in response to pain or stress. They are responsible for the runner's high that people experience and they can also be released when listening to music.It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. The power of Music can be testified by the legends about Tansen of his bringing the rains by singing Raag Megh Malhar and lighting lamps by Raga Deepak. It also helps in improving the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.
